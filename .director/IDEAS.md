# Ideas

_Captured ideas that aren't in the gameplan yet. Add with `/director:idea "..."`_

- **2026-02-16 21:30** -- Project data integrity check: a health check that verifies `.director/` contents are intact (VISION.md, STATE.md, GAMEPLAN.md, goal folders, etc.) and can recover missing files from git history. More valuable than plugin integrity alone since this is the user's actual work.
