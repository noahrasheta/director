# Ideas

_Captured ideas that aren't in the gameplan yet. Add with `/director:idea "..."`_

- **2026-02-16 22:01** -- I should do an audit to see if the onboarding process for new users is as thorough as a really well-made PRD document. So I've used this system already on existing code bases, and the process of mapping an existing code base is very thorough. I want to see how it works on a new code base. Let's say I'm taking a new idea because I have some plugins that do an incredible job at creating the initial PRD. I want to make sure that this will work for people who are doing new ideas, and that it's really extracting out of them all of the details necessary for the equivalent of a very thorough PRD document

- **2026-02-16 21:30** -- Project data integrity check: a health check that verifies `.director/` contents are intact (VISION.md, STATE.md, GAMEPLAN.md, goal folders, etc.) and can recover missing files from git history. More valuable than plugin integrity alone since this is the user's actual work.
