## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 10 phases derived from 88 requirements across 9 categories, with FLEX split into Quick/Ideas (Phase 7) and Pivot/Brainstorm (Phase 8) for cleaner delivery boundaries
- [Roadmap]: Phases 5-8 all depend on Phase 4, enabling potential parallel work after execution engine is built

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Claude Code v1.0.33+ required for `context: fork` in skills -- verify version compatibility early in Phase 1
- [Research]: Context budget calculator needed to prevent context rot in fresh agent windows -- design during Phase 1, implement in Phase 4
- [Research]: Documentation sync should never auto-commit -- always present findings to user first (Phase 4, Plan 04-06)
