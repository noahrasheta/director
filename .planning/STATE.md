# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-07)

**Core value:** Vibe coders can go from idea to working product through a guided, plain-language workflow (Blueprint / Build / Inspect) that gives them professional development structure without requiring them to think like a developer.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Plugin Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Plugin Foundation)
Plan: 5 of 7 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-08 -- Completed 01-06-PLAN.md

Progress: [█████░░░░░] ~57%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: ~3m
- Total execution time: ~15 minutes

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-plugin-foundation | 5/7 | ~15m | ~3m |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (1m 52s), 01-02 (4m), 01-03 (2m 31s), 01-04 (3m 15s), 01-06 (3m)
- Trend: stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 10 phases derived from 88 requirements across 9 categories, with FLEX split into Quick/Ideas (Phase 7) and Pivot/Brainstorm (Phase 8) for cleaner delivery boundaries
- [Roadmap]: Phases 5-8 all depend on Phase 4, enabling potential parallel work after execution engine is built
- [01-01]: Plugin manifest uses name "director" to namespace all skills as /director:*
- [01-01]: Only plugin.json inside .claude-plugin/; all other components at plugin root
- [01-01]: Config defaults are opinionated (guided mode, tips/verification/cost-tracking/doc-sync all on)
- [01-01]: Agent models: inherit for complex agents, haiku for lightweight (mapper, verifier, syncer)
- [01-02]: Never-use word list has 30+ jargon terms in 4 categories for consistent plain-language output
- [01-02]: Two verification severity levels: "needs attention" (blocking) and "worth checking" (informational)
- [01-02]: Agent-specific context profiles table defines what each of 8 agents receives
- [01-02]: Context budget calculator deferred to Phase 4 with design notes captured in reference doc
- [01-03]: Help skill uses dynamic context injection (cat STATE.md) for mini-status
- [01-03]: Help groups commands into Blueprint/Build/Inspect/Other matching Director's core loop
- [01-03]: Onboard routing checks VISION.md content quality (not just existence) to detect empty templates
- [01-03]: Blueprint routing redirects to onboard conversationally when vision is missing
- [01-03]: Config defaults template uses nested object format for agent models (matching plan spec)
- [01-03]: All routing messages follow four-step pattern: state situation, explain why, suggest action, wait for response
- [01-04]: All routing messages are conversational ("Want to..." not "Run /director:...")
- [01-04]: Idea skill is partially functional in Phase 1 -- actually captures ideas to IDEAS.md
- [01-04]: Build skill has exact multi-step routing: project -> vision -> gameplan -> ready task
- [01-04]: Status and resume use dynamic context injection to load STATE.md at invocation time
- [01-06]: Builder is the only agent with memory: project in Phase 1 (others deferred to Phase 2)
- [01-06]: Verifier uses hard deny (disallowedTools); syncer uses soft instruction for scope restriction
- [01-06]: Debugger has full write access to apply fixes directly during verification cycles

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Claude Code v1.0.33+ required for `context: fork` in skills -- verify version compatibility early in Phase 1
- [Research]: Context budget calculator needed to prevent context rot in fresh agent windows -- design during Phase 1, implement in Phase 4
- [Research]: Documentation sync should never auto-commit -- always present findings to user first (Phase 4, Plan 04-06)
