<objective>
Create the remaining 8 slash command skills: build, quick, inspect, status, resume, brainstorm, pivot, and idea. Each has context-aware routing that detects project state and guides users conversationally.

Purpose: These complete the full set of 11 Director commands. In Phase 1, none execute their full workflow -- they intelligently route users to the right starting point and explain what they'll do once functional. This ensures no command is a dead end.
Output: 8 skill definitions + 1 brainstorm session template.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create build, quick, inspect, and status skills</name>
  <files>skills/build/SKILL.md, skills/quick/SKILL.md, skills/inspect/SKILL.md, skills/status/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
All skills follow the same pattern: YAML frontmatter (name, description under 150 chars, disable-model-invocation: true) + markdown body with routing logic + `$ARGUMENTS` at the end.

**`skills/build/SKILL.md`** (name: build):
Description: "Work on the next ready task in your project. Picks up where you left off automatically."

Routing logic (multi-step, per user decision):
1. Check `.director/` exists. If not, create silently via init-director.sh, say "Director is ready."
2. Check `.director/VISION.md` has real content. If not: "We're not ready to build yet. You need to start with `/director:onboard` first to define what you're building. Ready to get started?" Wait for response. If they agree, proceed as onboard.
3. Check `.director/GAMEPLAN.md` has tasks. If not: "You have a vision but no gameplan yet. Let's create one with `/director:blueprint` so we know what to build first. Want to do that now?" Wait for response.
4. Check `.director/STATE.md` for a task with status "ready". If none: "All tasks are either complete or waiting on something else. Here's where things stand:" then show current progress summary.
5. If a ready task exists: "This command will be fully functional in a future update. The next ready task is: [task name from state]. Stay tuned!"

**`skills/quick/SKILL.md`** (name: quick):
Description: "Make a fast change without full planning. Best for small, focused tasks."

Routing logic:
1. Check `.director/` exists. If not, create silently.
2. Check if `$ARGUMENTS` contains a task description. If empty: "What would you like to change? Try something like: `/director:quick \"change the button color to blue\"`"
3. If arguments present, analyze the request's apparent complexity:
   - If it sounds complex (mentions multiple features, architectural changes, "redesign", "refactor", multiple pages): "That sounds like it might need some planning first. Want to use `/director:blueprint` to break it into steps? Or should I go ahead and try it as a quick task?"
   - If simple: "This command will be fully functional in a future update. Once it is, it will handle this change for you with a single step."

**`skills/inspect/SKILL.md`** (name: inspect):
Description: "Check that what was built actually works. Runs verification on your project."

Routing logic:
1. Check `.director/` exists. If not, create silently.
2. Check if any tasks have been completed (STATE.md shows completed tasks). If nothing built: "Nothing to inspect yet. Want to get started with `/director:onboard`?"
3. If tasks completed: "This command will be fully functional in a future update. Once it is, it will verify your work matches your goals -- checking that code is real (not placeholders) and everything is connected."

**`skills/status/SKILL.md`** (name: status):
Description: "See your project progress at a glance."

Use dynamic context injection to load state:
```
<project_state>
!`cat .director/STATE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_PROJECT"`
</project_state>

<project_config>
!`cat .director/config.json 2>/dev/null || echo "{}"`
</project_config>
```

Routing logic:
1. If no project exists: "No project set up yet. Want to get started with `/director:onboard`?"
2. If project exists: Read the injected state and show progress. "This command will be fully functional in a future update. For now, here's what I can see from your project state:" and display whatever's in STATE.md in a friendly format.

IMPORTANT for all skills: Keep description fields under 150 characters. Never use developer jargon in routing messages. All suggestions should be conversational ("Want to..." not "Run /director:..."). Follow the routing message template from plain-language-guide.md.

  <name>Task 2: Create resume, brainstorm, pivot, and idea skills</name>

  <action>
**`skills/resume/SKILL.md`** (name: resume):
Description: "Pick up where you left off after a break. Restores your context automatically."

Use dynamic context injection:
```
<project_state>
!`cat .director/STATE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_PROJECT"`
</project_state>
```

Routing logic:
1. If no project: "No project to resume. Want to get started with `/director:onboard`?"
2. If project exists: Read STATE.md and provide a plain-language summary: "Welcome back. [Summary of where they left off and what's next]." Then say: "This command will be fully functional in a future update. Once it is, it will restore your full context and suggest what to work on next."

The resume output should follow this pattern: "Welcome back. Last time, you [what was last completed]. Next up: [next ready task or step]."

**`skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md`** (name: brainstorm):
Description: "Think out loud with full project context. Explore ideas one question at a time."

Routing logic:
1. Check `.director/` exists. If not, create silently.
2. If project has a vision: "This command will be fully functional in a future update. Once it is, it will load your full project context and help you explore ideas -- one question at a time, with your codebase in mind."
3. If no vision: "Want to brainstorm from scratch? Try `/director:onboard` first to capture your initial vision, then come back here to explore ideas."
4. Include `$ARGUMENTS` for topic focus (e.g., `/director:brainstorm "what about real-time collab?"`).

**Create `skills/brainstorm/templates/brainstorm-session.md`:**
Template for saved brainstorm sessions:
- Header: "# Brainstorm: [Topic]"
- Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Sections: Context (what prompted this), Discussion (key points explored), Ideas Generated (bulleted list), Suggested Next Steps (what to do with these ideas -- save as idea, create task, trigger pivot, or just keep for reference)

**`skills/pivot/SKILL.md`** (name: pivot):
Description: "Handle a change in direction for your project. Maps impact and updates your gameplan."

Routing logic:
1. Check `.director/` exists. If not, create silently.
2. Check if project has a vision and gameplan. If no vision: "Before pivoting, we need to know what you're pivoting FROM. Want to start with `/director:onboard`?"
3. If vision exists but no gameplan: "You have a vision but no gameplan yet. Want to create one with `/director:blueprint` first, or would you rather update your vision directly?"
4. If both exist: "This command will be fully functional in a future update. Once it is, it will help you change direction by mapping what you've built against where you want to go, then update your gameplan to match."
5. Include `$ARGUMENTS` for context (e.g., `/director:pivot "dropping mobile, going web-only"`).

**`skills/idea/SKILL.md`** (name: idea):
Description: "Capture an idea for later without interrupting your flow."

Routing logic:
1. Check `.director/` exists. If not, create silently.
2. Check if `$ARGUMENTS` contains an idea. If empty: "What's your idea? Try: `/director:idea \"add dark mode support\"`"
3. If arguments present: Append the idea to `.director/IDEAS.md` with a timestamp. Say: "Got it! Saved to your ideas list. You can review all your ideas anytime."
4. Note: This command IS partially functional in Phase 1 -- it can actually append to IDEAS.md since that's simple file I/O. The "analysis and routing" part (determining if an idea should be a quick task, planned feature, etc.) comes in Phase 7.

IMPORTANT: The idea skill is unique -- it CAN do its core job (capture text to a file) in Phase 1. Don't defer the capture functionality. Only defer the analysis/routing.

All skills: disable-model-invocation: true, description under 150 chars, conversational routing messages, `$ARGUMENTS` at the end.
