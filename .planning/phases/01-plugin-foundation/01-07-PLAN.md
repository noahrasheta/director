<objective>
Create the marketplace manifest for plugin distribution (PLUG-10), add README and CHANGELOG, then verify the complete plugin loads correctly in Claude Code with all components registered.

Purpose: This is the capstone plan that completes PLUG-10 (marketplace distribution) and verifies all 10 requirements are met. The checkpoint confirms the plugin actually works as a coherent whole.
Output: Marketplace manifest, README, CHANGELOG, and verified working plugin.

  <action>
**Create `marketplace.json`** -- self-hosted plugin marketplace manifest:

Following the Claude Code plugin marketplace documentation, create a marketplace manifest that allows users to install Director by adding the marketplace URL to Claude Code.

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "director",
      "description": "Opinionated orchestration framework for vibe coders. Guides the entire build process from vision to working product.",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "source": {
        "type": "github",
        "url": "https://github.com/noahrasheta/director"
      },
      "homepage": "https://director.cc",
      "author": "Noah Rasheta",
      "license": "MIT",
      "keywords": ["orchestration", "vibe-coding", "workflow", "planning", "ai-agents"],
      "min_claude_code_version": "1.0.33"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: The marketplace manifest can be hosted at director.cc or on GitHub. The `source.type` and `source.url` tell Claude Code where to download the plugin from. Adjust based on actual hosting decision.

**Create `README.md`:**

Write a user-facing README (not developer-focused):
- Title: Director
- Tagline: "Opinionated orchestration for vibe coders"
- What it does: 2-3 sentences explaining Director helps solo builders go from idea to working product
- Installation: How to install via Claude Code (marketplace URL or `claude plugin install`)
- Quick start: Run `/director:onboard` to begin
- Commands: Same grouping as help (Blueprint / Build / Inspect / Other) with brief descriptions and examples
- Requirements: Claude Code v1.0.33+
- License: MIT
- Link to director.cc for full documentation

Keep language accessible to vibe coders. No jargon.

**Create `CHANGELOG.md`:**

```markdown
# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (Unreleased)

### Added
- Plugin manifest and registration with Claude Code
- 11 slash commands: onboard, blueprint, build, quick, inspect, status, resume, brainstorm, pivot, idea, help
- 8 specialized agents: interviewer, planner, researcher, mapper, builder, verifier, debugger, syncer
- Silent .director/ initialization on first command
- Help command with dynamic project status
- Context-aware routing for all commands
- Opinionated config.json defaults
- Artifact templates: Vision, Gameplan, Goal, Step, Task, brainstorm session
- Reference docs: terminology, plain-language guide, verification patterns, context management
- Self-hosted marketplace manifest
```
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify marketplace.json is valid JSON: `python3 -m json.tool marketplace.json`.
Verify README.md exists and lists commands: `grep -c "/director:" README.md` should return 11+.
Verify CHANGELOG.md lists version 0.1.0: `grep "0.1.0" CHANGELOG.md`.
  </verify>
  <done>marketplace.json provides a valid marketplace manifest for Claude Code plugin distribution. README.md documents installation and all commands in vibe-coder-friendly language. CHANGELOG.md tracks the initial 0.1.0 release.</done>

  <what-built>
Complete Director plugin (Phase 1): plugin manifest, 11 slash commands with context-aware routing, 8 specialized agents with full system prompts, initialization scripts, hooks, reference docs, templates, config defaults, and marketplace manifest.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Load the plugin: `claude --plugin-dir /Users/noahrasheta/Dev/GitHub/director`
2. Verify commands register: Run `/director:help` -- should show all 11 commands grouped by Blueprint / Build / Inspect / Other with inline examples
3. Verify agents register: Type `/agents` -- should list all 8 director-* agents
4. Test initialization: In a temporary directory, run any `/director:` command and verify `.director/` is created silently with VISION.md, GAMEPLAN.md, STATE.md, IDEAS.md, config.json, brainstorms/, goals/
5. Test routing: Run `/director:build` -- should detect no vision and route to onboard conversationally ("We're not ready to build yet...")
6. Test idea capture: Run `/director:idea "test idea"` -- should append to `.director/IDEAS.md`
7. Verify config.json: Open `.director/config.json` -- should have config_version: 1 with all defaults
8. Check for jargon: Read through the help output and routing messages -- no developer jargon should be visible
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if the plugin loads correctly and all checks pass, or describe any issues found.</resume-signal>
</task>
