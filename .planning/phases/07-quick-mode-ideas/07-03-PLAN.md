<objective>
Create the new `/director:ideas` (plural) skill that displays saved ideas, enables conversational selection, analyzes complexity to suggest a routing destination, and removes ideas from IDEAS.md when acted on.

Purpose: This is the second half of the idea workflow. While `/director:idea` (singular) captures thoughts instantly, `/director:ideas` (plural) is where users come back to review and act on their saved ideas. The routing conversation should feel natural -- Director suggests ONE route with reasoning, not a menu of options.

Output: A new `skills/ideas/SKILL.md` file in a new `skills/ideas/` directory.

  <name>Task 1: Create ideas viewer skill with conversational routing</name>
  <files>skills/ideas/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Create the directory `skills/ideas/` and the file `skills/ideas/SKILL.md`. This is a new skill that Claude Code will auto-discover from the skills/ directory.

**YAML frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: ideas
description: "Review your saved ideas and decide what to do with them."
disable-model-invocation: true
---
```

The skill follows this step structure:

**Step 1: Check for Director project**
- Same init check pattern as other skills: if `.director/` does not exist, run `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/init-director.sh` silently.

**Step 2: Read and display ideas**
- Read `.director/IDEAS.md`.
- Parse the file: skip the header (`# Ideas`) and description line (`_Captured ideas..._`). Each remaining non-blank line that starts with `- **[` is an idea entry.
- If no idea entries found, say: "Your ideas list is empty. Capture ideas anytime with `/director:idea \"...\"`" and stop.
- Display ideas as a numbered list, stripping the markdown formatting for readability:
  ```
  Here are your saved ideas:

  1. Add dark mode support for the entire app (Feb 8)
  2. Change the submit button color to match the brand (Feb 8)
  3. Maybe add a search feature? (Feb 7)

  Which one interests you? (Pick a number, or say "none" to keep them saved.)
  ```
- The display format: number, idea text (extracted from after the `--` in each entry), and abbreviated date (extracted from the timestamp).
- Wait for the user's response.

**Step 3: Handle selection**
- Parse the user's response. Accept:
  - A number ("3", "#3", "number 3")
  - Natural language ("the search one", "dark mode", "let's work on the last one")
  - "none" / "nevermind" / "not now" -- say "No problem -- your ideas are saved for whenever you're ready." and stop.
- If the selection is ambiguous, ask for clarification.
- Once a specific idea is identified, continue to Step 4.

**Step 4: Analyze and suggest route**
- Analyze the selected idea's complexity using the same scope-based heuristics as the quick skill:
  - **Quick task indicators:** single change, cosmetic update, small fix, straightforward addition, configuration change.
  - **Blueprint indicators:** multiple features, architectural changes, cross-cutting concerns, new system-level capabilities.
  - **Brainstorm indicators:** exploratory language ("maybe", "what if", "I wonder", "explore", "consider"), vague scope ("somehow", "something like"), questions rather than statements.
- Suggest ONE route with natural-language reasoning. The tone should be conversational, not a menu:
  - Quick route: "That's a straightforward change -- I can handle it as a quick task. Sound good?"
  - Blueprint route: "This one needs some planning -- it touches [specific reason]. Want to add it to your gameplan with `/director:blueprint`?"
  - Brainstorm route: "This is interesting but needs some exploration first. Want to brainstorm it with `/director:brainstorm`?"
- Wait for the user's confirmation.
- If the user disagrees with the suggested route, accept their preference. If they suggest a different route, go with it.

**Step 5: Execute the route**
- **Quick route (user confirmed):**
  1. Remove the idea from IDEAS.md (see removal mechanic below).
  2. Execute the quick mode flow directly: follow the same steps as the quick skill starting from Step 4 (check uncommitted changes) through Step 8 (post-task summary). Assemble context and spawn the builder the same way the quick skill does, using the idea text as the $ARGUMENTS equivalent.
  3. The idea is now acted on -- it lives in git history via the [quick] commit.

- **Blueprint route (user confirmed):**
  1. Remove the idea from IDEAS.md.
  2. Tell the user: "I've removed it from your ideas list. Run `/director:blueprint \"[idea text]\"` to plan it out." Do NOT auto-execute blueprint.
  3. Stop.

- **Brainstorm route (user confirmed):**
  1. Do NOT remove the idea from IDEAS.md (brainstorming is exploration, not action -- the idea stays until it becomes a concrete plan or quick task).
  2. Tell the user: "Run `/director:brainstorm \"[idea text]\"` to explore it. I'll keep it in your ideas list until you decide what to do with it."
  3. Stop.

**Removal mechanic:**
When removing an idea from IDEAS.md:
1. Read the file content.
2. Find the line matching the selected idea (match by the full `- **[timestamp]** -- text` pattern).
3. Remove that entire line.
4. If removing the line leaves consecutive blank lines, collapse them to a single blank line.
5. Write the file back.

**Language reminders:** Same rules as other skills -- Director vocabulary, no jargon, conversational tone.

Include `$ARGUMENTS` at the end (in case the user runs `/director:ideas "dark mode"` to jump directly to a specific idea).

**Key constraints from locked decisions:**
- Three routing destinations: quick task, blueprint, brainstorm (locked)
- Conversational routing with confirmation, not a menu (locked)
- No auto-execution for blueprint or brainstorm routes (locked)
- Acted-on ideas removed from IDEAS.md (locked) -- except brainstorm which keeps them
- Suggest ONE route with reasoning, not options (locked)
  </action>
  <verify>
Read `skills/ideas/SKILL.md` and verify:
1. YAML frontmatter has name: ideas, description, disable-model-invocation: true
2. Step 1 has init check
3. Step 2 reads IDEAS.md, parses entries, displays numbered list with dates
4. Step 2 handles empty IDEAS.md with suggestion to capture ideas
5. Step 3 handles number selection, natural language selection, and "none"
6. Step 4 analyzes complexity with scope-based heuristics (quick/blueprint/brainstorm indicators)
7. Step 4 suggests ONE route conversationally (not a menu)
8. Step 5 quick route: removes idea, executes quick flow directly
9. Step 5 blueprint route: removes idea, tells user to run /director:blueprint
10. Step 5 brainstorm route: does NOT remove idea, tells user to run /director:brainstorm
11. Removal mechanic finds idea by full pattern and removes the line
12. Language reminders present
13. $ARGUMENTS at end
14. File is at least 120 lines
  </verify>
  <done>
The ideas skill shows a numbered list of saved ideas, lets the user pick one conversationally, suggests a single route with natural-language reasoning (quick/blueprint/brainstorm), confirms before proceeding, executes the route (quick inline, or directs to blueprint/brainstorm), and removes acted-on ideas from IDEAS.md (except brainstorm which keeps them for later).
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `skills/ideas/SKILL.md` exists in new `skills/ideas/` directory
- Skill displays ideas as numbered list (dynamic numbering, not stored in file)
- Conversational selection accepts numbers and natural language
- Route suggestion is ONE suggestion with reasoning, not a menu (per locked decision)
- Quick route removes idea and executes inline
- Blueprint route removes idea and directs to command (no auto-execution per locked decision)
- Brainstorm route keeps idea and directs to command
- Empty IDEAS.md handled gracefully
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- New /director:ideas command is fully functional with viewer, routing, and removal
- Routing feels conversational per user's specific vision ("That's a straightforward change -- I can handle it as a quick task. Sound good?")
- All three routing destinations work correctly with proper removal behavior
- Requirement FLEX-12 fully addressed (idea analysis and routing)
- All locked decisions from CONTEXT.md honored (conversational routing, no auto-execution, three destinations, confirmation gate)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/07-quick-mode-ideas/07-03-SUMMARY.md`
