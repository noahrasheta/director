<objective>
Rewrite the pivot skill's opening steps -- init checks, routing (no vision, no gameplan), capturing what changed (inline arguments or conversational), and scope detection (tactical vs strategic with ambiguity fallback). This replaces the current placeholder "will be fully functional in a future update" message with the first three steps of a complete pivot workflow.

Purpose: This is the entry point for pivot -- how the user starts the conversation about changing direction. It must detect project state, capture the user's intent, and classify the scope of change before any analysis begins.

Output: A partially rewritten `skills/pivot/SKILL.md` with Steps 1-3 fully implemented. Later plans (08-02 through 08-04) will add Steps 4-9 to complete the skill.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite pivot SKILL.md Steps 1-3 (init, routing, capture, scope detection)</name>
  <files>skills/pivot/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Replace the entire content of `skills/pivot/SKILL.md` with the beginning of a complete pivot workflow. Keep the existing YAML frontmatter (name: pivot, description, disable-model-invocation: true).

The skill body should contain:

**Opening preamble:**
- "You are Director's pivot command. Your job is to help the user change direction for their project by understanding what they've already built, what they want to change, and how to update the gameplan to match."
- Read references: `reference/plain-language-guide.md` and `reference/terminology.md`
- "Follow all steps below IN ORDER."

**Step 1: Init + Vision + Gameplan checks**
- Check if `.director/` exists. If not, run init script silently.
- Read `.director/VISION.md`. If template-only (same detection pattern as build skill), say: "Before pivoting, we need to know what you're pivoting FROM. Want to start with `/director:onboard`?" Stop if no vision.
- Read `.director/GAMEPLAN.md`. If template-only, say: "You have a vision but no gameplan yet. Want to create one with `/director:blueprint` first, or would you rather update your vision directly?" Wait for response. Stop if no gameplan.
- Both exist: continue to Step 2.

**Step 2: Capture what changed**
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty: acknowledge the pivot context conversationally ("Got it -- [brief restatement]. Let me look at what that means for your project.") and skip to scope detection.
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty: open a conversation with something like "What's changed about your project?" -- conversational, not a formal interview. Follow up with clarifying questions until the pivot direction is clear. Keep it natural -- "Tell me more about that" not "Please specify requirement ID."
- Store the captured pivot context internally for use in later steps.

**Step 3: Detect pivot scope**
- Analyze the user's pivot description for scope signals.
- Tactical signals (approach change, gameplan-only update): technology mentions ("switching to", "using X instead of Y"), implementation approach changes ("refactoring", "restructuring", "reorganizing"), scope narrowing ("dropping X for now", "simplifying", "web-only"), architecture changes ("monorepo", "serverless", "different hosting").
- Strategic signals (direction change, vision + gameplan update): product identity changes ("it's not a X anymore, it's a Y"), audience change ("targeting enterprises", "for teams instead of solo"), core feature overhaul ("dropping the social features entirely"), purpose change ("the goal is now...").
- If clearly tactical: state it conversationally ("This sounds like a change in approach -- your vision still holds, just the plan needs updating.") and proceed.
- If clearly strategic: state it conversationally ("This changes the direction of what you're building. We'll want to update your vision first, then rebuild the plan around it.") and proceed.
- If ambiguous: ask the user with a plain-language question: "This could be a tweak to your approach (your vision stays the same, just the plan changes) or a bigger shift in what you're building. Which feels closer? A) Just changing the approach -- the vision is still right B) Changing direction -- the vision needs updating too" Wait for response before proceeding.

**Placeholder for remaining steps:**
After Step 3, add a comment marker: `<!-- Steps 4-9 will be added in plans 08-02 through 08-04 -->`

Then include the Language Reminders section (same as build/blueprint skills) and `$ARGUMENTS` at the end.

**Important patterns to follow (from research):**
- Run conversation inline -- do NOT spawn the interviewer agent
- Scope detection is a heuristic with explicit fallback to asking the user per locked decision
- Multiple-choice format for the ambiguity question is acceptable per interview rules
- Conversational tone throughout -- "What's changed?" not "Please specify your pivot requirements"

  <verify>
Read `skills/pivot/SKILL.md` and verify:
1. YAML frontmatter preserved (name: pivot, disable-model-invocation: true)
2. Step 1 checks .director/, VISION.md, GAMEPLAN.md with appropriate routing
3. Step 2 handles both $ARGUMENTS (skip interview) and empty args (open conversation)
4. Step 3 has tactical and strategic signal lists
5. Step 3 asks the user when ambiguous (A/B choice)
6. Language reminders section present
7. $ARGUMENTS at the end
8. File is at least 100 lines
  </verify>
  <done>
Pivot skill has init routing (vision/gameplan checks), dual entry paths (inline arguments or conversation), and scope detection (tactical vs strategic with ambiguity fallback). The placeholder Steps 4-9 marker is present for subsequent plans.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `skills/pivot/SKILL.md` is no longer a placeholder -- Steps 1-3 are fully implemented
- Vision/gameplan routing follows established patterns (build skill, blueprint skill)
- Both inline and conversational entry paths work per locked decision
- Scope detection distinguishes tactical from strategic with explicit ambiguity handling
- No interviewer agent spawning (inline conversation per research recommendation)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Pivot skill Steps 1-3 are complete (init + capture + scope detection)
- Locked decisions honored: dual entry paths, scope detection asks when ambiguous, tactical updates gameplan only, strategic updates vision + gameplan
- File is structured for clean extension in plans 08-02 through 08-04
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/08-pivot-brainstorm/08-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
