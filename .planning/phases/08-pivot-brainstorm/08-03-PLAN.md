<objective>
Add pivot Steps 6-7 to the existing skill file -- impact analysis that classifies all gameplan items against the new direction, and delta summary generation that presents changes for user approval. This is the analytical core of the pivot workflow.

Purpose: Steps 6-7 determine WHAT changes and present it clearly. Impact analysis compares every goal/step/task against the new direction. The delta summary gives the user a complete picture of what will change before anything is actually modified, ensuring informed consent.

Output: Updated `skills/pivot/SKILL.md` with Steps 6-7 inserted before the placeholder marker.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add pivot Steps 6-7 (impact analysis and delta summary with approval)</name>
  <files>skills/pivot/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Read the current `skills/pivot/SKILL.md` (which has Steps 1-5 from plans 08-01 and 08-02). Replace the `<!-- Steps 6-9 -->` placeholder with Steps 6-7 and update the placeholder to `<!-- Steps 8-9 will be added in plan 08-04 -->`.

**Step 6: Impact analysis**

Read the full gameplan structure to understand everything that exists:
1. Read `.director/GAMEPLAN.md` for the overview and goal list.
2. Scan `.director/goals/` directory. For each goal, read GOAL.md, each STEP.md, and all task files.
3. Identify completed work -- any goals, steps, or tasks marked as done/complete. These are FROZEN per the blueprint update mode rule.
4. Classify each item against the new direction captured in Step 2:

   - **Still relevant:** No change needed -- this work contributes to the new direction as-is.
   - **Needs modification:** The work is still useful but needs adjustments to fit the new direction.
   - **No longer needed:** This pending work does not contribute to the new direction. (For completed work that is now irrelevant: flag it and propose cleanup tasks rather than removal. Completed work is NEVER removed.)
   - **New work required:** The new direction requires goals, steps, or tasks that do not exist yet.

5. For completed work that is now irrelevant to the new direction: flag it explicitly. Do NOT propose deletion. Instead, propose adding cleanup tasks to the new gameplan (e.g., "The old login page is built but no longer needed. I'll add a cleanup task to remove it when you're ready."). Per locked decision: "Director flags it and adds cleanup tasks to the new gameplan (not removed automatically)."

6. For the new direction, generate new goals, steps, and tasks following the same planning rules as blueprint (Rules 1-6: outcomes not activities, verifiable steps, single-sitting tasks, plain-language prerequisites, ready-work filtering, vertical slices).

**Step 7: Generate and present delta summary**

Scale the presentation to the pivot scope:
- Strategic pivots (direction change): present at goal-level granularity first, then expand to steps.
- Tactical pivots (approach change): present at step/task-level granularity directly.

Use the blueprint update mode's delta format:

> Here's what would change:
>
> **Added:**
> - [New item with explanation of why it is needed for the new direction]
>
> **Changed:**
> - [Modified item: was X, now Y, because of the pivot]
>
> **Removed:**
> - [Pending item removed with reasoning -- only pending items, never completed]
>
> **Reordered:**
> - [Item moved: was in Step X, now in Step Y, because of the pivot]
>
> **Already done (keeping as-is):**
> - [Completed items preserved -- even if now irrelevant, they stay]
>
> [If completed work is now irrelevant:]
> **Completed but no longer needed:**
> - [Completed item] -- I'll add a cleanup task for this.

Every removal must be explicitly stated with reasoning. No silent deletions. The "Already done" section ALWAYS appears, even if just to say "Nothing completed yet."

After the delta summary, present the full updated gameplan outline (same format as blueprint: goals, steps, tasks with one-line descriptions and size indicators):

> Here's what the updated gameplan would look like:
>
> **Goal 1: [Goal Name]** [done/updated/new]
>   Step 1: [Step name] [done/updated/new]
>     - [Task name] (size) -- Done/Ready/Needs [capability]
>
> Does this look right? I won't make any changes until you say so.

Wait for explicit approval. If the user gives feedback (modify the delta, keep something that was proposed for removal, add something else), adjust and re-present. Iterate until approved.

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT write any files until the user explicitly approves.** This is the same approval pattern as blueprint update mode. The user must confirm before any changes are applied.

**Pattern references:**
- Delta format directly from blueprint update mode (Phase 3, Plan 02)
- Planning Rules 1-6 from blueprint skill for generating new items
- Completed work FROZEN rule from blueprint update mode
- Explicit approval before writing from blueprint update mode

Read `skills/pivot/SKILL.md` and verify:
1. Step 6 reads GAMEPLAN.md and scans goals/ directory structure
2. Step 6 classifies items as still relevant/needs modification/no longer needed/new
3. Step 6 FREEZES completed work (never removed, cleanup tasks proposed instead)
4. Step 6 generates new goals/steps/tasks following planning rules
5. Step 7 uses delta format: Added/Changed/Removed/Reordered/Already done
6. Step 7 includes "Completed but no longer needed" section when applicable
7. Step 7 scales granularity to pivot scope (goal-level for strategic, task-level for tactical)
8. Step 7 presents full updated gameplan outline after delta
9. Step 7 waits for explicit user approval
10. Placeholder updated to Steps 8-9
11. File is at least 240 lines
  </verify>
  <done>
Pivot skill has impact analysis (full gameplan classification against new direction) and delta summary (Added/Changed/Removed/Reordered/Already done format with approval gate). Completed work is never removed -- irrelevant completed work gets cleanup tasks. Changes are only applied after explicit user approval.

<verification>
- Impact analysis reads the full gameplan hierarchy (goals, steps, tasks)
- Classification covers all four states (still relevant, needs modification, no longer needed, new)
- Completed work is FROZEN per blueprint update mode rules
- Irrelevant completed work gets cleanup task proposals, not deletion
- Delta summary uses the established format from blueprint update mode
- Granularity scales with pivot scope per locked decision
- Explicit approval gate before any file writes
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Steps 6-7 are the analytical core -- they determine what changes and get user approval
- All locked decisions honored: delta format, frozen completed work, cleanup tasks for irrelevant work, user approval required
- Blueprint update mode patterns reused exactly where applicable
</success_criteria>
