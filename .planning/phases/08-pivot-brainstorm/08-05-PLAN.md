<objective>
Update the brainstorm session template to the new summary+highlights format, and rewrite the brainstorm skill's opening steps -- init check, lightweight context loading (VISION.md + STATE.md only), and session opening with topic framing. This replaces the current placeholder with the beginning of a complete brainstorm workflow.

Purpose: The template update ensures saved sessions follow the user-approved format. The skill rewrite establishes the brainstorm's entry point with adaptive context loading -- starting lightweight to keep costs low for casual sessions.

Output: An updated `skills/brainstorm/templates/brainstorm-session.md` and a partially rewritten `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` with Steps 1-3.

  <files>skills/brainstorm/templates/brainstorm-session.md</files>
  <action>
Replace the entire content of `skills/brainstorm/templates/brainstorm-session.md` with the updated format from the research findings.

The new template structure:

```markdown
# Brainstorm: [Topic]

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Summary

### Key Ideas
- [Idea 1 -- one sentence each]
- [Idea 2]
- [Idea 3]

### Decisions Made
- [Decision 1 -- if any decisions emerged during the session]

### Open Questions
- [Question 1 -- unresolved items worth revisiting]

## Highlights

[Key excerpts from the conversation that capture important insights, reasoning, or context. Not the full transcript -- just the parts worth revisiting.]

## Suggested Next Action

[ONE action that fits best: save as idea, quick task, blueprint update, pivot, or "Session saved -- pick it back up anytime."]
```

This replaces the old Context/Discussion/Ideas Generated/Suggested Next Steps format with the user-approved summary+highlights format per CONTEXT.md decisions.

1. Has "# Brainstorm: [Topic]" heading
2. Has Date field
3. Has Summary section with Key Ideas, Decisions Made, and Open Questions subsections
4. Has Highlights section

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Rewrite brainstorm SKILL.md Steps 1-3 (init, context loading, session open)</name>
  <files>skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Replace the entire content of `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` with the beginning of a complete brainstorm workflow. Keep the existing YAML frontmatter (name: brainstorm, description: "Think out loud with full project context. Explore ideas one question at a time.", disable-model-invocation: true).

The skill body should contain:

**Opening preamble:**
- "You are Director's brainstorm command. Your job is to help the user explore ideas freely while keeping their full project context in mind. Brainstorming should feel like a creative conversation, not a planning session."
- Read references: `reference/plain-language-guide.md` and `reference/terminology.md`
- "Follow all steps below IN ORDER."

**Step 1: Init + Vision check**
- Check if `.director/` exists. If not, run init script silently.
- Read `.director/VISION.md`. If template-only (same detection as build skill): "Want to brainstorm from scratch? Try `/director:onboard` first to capture your initial vision, then come back here to explore ideas." Stop if no vision.
- Note: brainstorm does NOT require a gameplan. Users can brainstorm with just a vision.

**Step 2: Load initial context**
- Read `.director/VISION.md` -- understand what the project is about.
- Read `.director/STATE.md` -- understand current progress and recent activity.
- Do NOT read GAMEPLAN.md, codebase files, step files, or task files yet. These are loaded on-demand during the conversation (Step 4). This keeps costs low for casual brainstorming sessions.
- Store the vision and state context internally for use throughout the session.

**Step 3: Open the session**
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty: "Let's explore [topic from arguments]. What prompted this?" -- acknowledge the topic and invite elaboration.
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty: "What are you thinking about?" -- open-ended, exploratory tone.
- Set the conversational tone: this is exploration, not planning. Match the user's energy with a bias toward supportive exploration.

**Placeholder for remaining steps:**
After Step 3, add a comment marker: `<!-- Steps 4-6 will be added in plans 08-06 and 08-07 -->`

Then include a Language Reminders section and `$ARGUMENTS` at the end.

**Important patterns:**
- Brainstorm does NOT require a gameplan (unlike pivot) -- works with just a vision
- Adaptive context loading is the key innovation: start light, escalate on demand
- Conversational tone: exploratory, supportive, not planning or interviewing
- Run inline -- do NOT spawn the interviewer agent
  </action>
  <verify>
Read `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` and verify:
1. YAML frontmatter preserved (name: brainstorm, disable-model-invocation: true)
2. Step 1 checks .director/ and VISION.md (but NOT GAMEPLAN.md)
3. Step 2 reads only VISION.md and STATE.md (explicit instruction NOT to load other files)
4. Step 3 handles both $ARGUMENTS (topic acknowledgment) and empty args ("What are you thinking about?")
5. Placeholder marker present for Steps 4-6
6. Language reminders section present
7. $ARGUMENTS at the end
8. File is at least 80 lines
  </verify>
  <done>
Brainstorm skill has init routing (vision check only, no gameplan required), lightweight context loading (VISION.md + STATE.md only), and session opening with both topic-specific and open-ended entry paths.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Template updated to summary+highlights format per CONTEXT.md decisions
- Brainstorm skill starts with lightweight context (only VISION.md + STATE.md)
- No gameplan required for brainstorming (unlike pivot)
- Both entry paths work: with arguments (topic-specific) and without (open-ended)
- No interviewer agent spawning (inline conversation)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Session template matches the format agreed in CONTEXT.md discussions
- Brainstorm skill Steps 1-3 implement adaptive context loading (start light)
- Locked decisions honored: guided-then-free opening, adaptive context loading, code-aware capability planned for Step 4
</success_criteria>
