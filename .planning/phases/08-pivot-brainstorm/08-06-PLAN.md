<objective>
Add brainstorm Step 4 to the existing skill file -- the exploration loop with adaptive context loading rules, code awareness, feasibility surfacing, and periodic check-ins. This is the conversational core where the brainstorm actually happens.

Purpose: Step 4 is the heart of brainstorming -- an open-ended conversation loop guided by skill instructions rather than rigid structure. Adaptive context loading keeps costs low while enabling deep exploration when the conversation demands it. Code awareness lets users reference their actual codebase during discussions.

Output: Updated `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` with Step 4 inserted before the placeholder marker.

  <name>Task 1: Add brainstorm Step 4 (exploration loop with adaptive context loading)</name>
  <files>skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Read the current `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` (which has Steps 1-3 from plan 08-05). Replace the `<!-- Steps 4-6 -->` placeholder with Step 4 and update the placeholder to `<!-- Steps 5-6 will be added in plan 08-07 -->`.

**Step 4: Exploration (conversational loop)**

This step is a set of behavioral instructions for Claude during the brainstorm conversation, not a linear procedure. Write it as guidance that shapes the conversation:

**Following the user's lead:**
- This is the user's brainstorm, not Director's. Follow wherever they go.
- One question or insight at a time. Do not dump multiple questions or long analyses.
- Keep responses to 200-300 words per exchange. If more detail is needed, break it into multiple exchanges.
- Validate the user's thinking before adding your own perspective: "That makes sense because..." before "Have you also considered..."

**Adaptive context loading rules:**
- Load GAMEPLAN.md when the user discusses: specific goals, steps, task ordering, progress, priorities, what to build next.
  - How to detect: user mentions goal names, step names, asks about ordering, references "the plan" or "the gameplan"
  - Action: Read `.director/GAMEPLAN.md` and relevant goal/step/task files. Use the content to ground the discussion.
- Load codebase files when the user discusses: specific features, code, components, pages, architecture.
  - How to detect: user mentions file names, component names, features by name, asks "how does X work", references specific code patterns
  - Action: Use the Read tool to load specific files. Use Glob to find files if the exact path is not known. Use Grep to search for patterns across the codebase. Share relevant findings naturally in the conversation.
- Load step/task files when the user discusses: specific planned work, upcoming tasks, blocked items.
  - How to detect: user mentions task names, asks what is next, references specific steps
  - Action: Read the relevant STEP.md or task files from `.director/goals/`.
- NEVER pre-load everything. Let the conversation drive what is needed. If the conversation stays high-level (feature ideas, product direction), the initial VISION.md + STATE.md context is sufficient.

**Surfacing feasibility concerns:**
- When the user explores an idea that has technical implications, surface concerns gently. Tone: "Love that idea. One thing to keep in mind: [concern]. Want to explore how to handle that, or keep going?"
- Do NOT block ideas with feasibility concerns. Present them as information, not gates.
- If you loaded codebase files and notice conflicts or complexity, mention it naturally: "Looking at your current setup, [observation]. That might mean [implication]. Worth thinking about."
- Per locked decision: "Surface feasibility concerns gently when they matter."

**Periodic check-ins:**
- Every 4-6 exchanges, check in during natural pauses: "Want to keep exploring this, or are we good?" or "Anything else on your mind, or should we wrap up?"
- Natural pauses include: a topic reaching a conclusion, the user's response getting shorter, a shift in topic.
- Do NOT interrupt mid-thought. Wait for a natural pause.
- If the user says "done", "that's it", "wrap up", or similar at any point, proceed to Step 5.

**Tone:**
- Match the user's energy with a bias toward supportive exploration.
- If they are excited, be excited. If they are analytical, be analytical. If they are uncertain, be encouraging.
- Brainstorming is inherently creative -- avoid being overly structured or formal.
- Use plain language throughout. Follow reference/terminology.md and reference/plain-language-guide.md.

Read `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` and verify:
1. Step 4 has "follow the user's lead" guidance
2. Step 4 specifies 200-300 word response length
3. Step 4 has adaptive context loading rules with specific triggers for GAMEPLAN.md, codebase files, and step/task files
4. Step 4 mentions Read, Glob, and Grep tools for codebase access
5. Step 4 explicitly says "NEVER pre-load everything"
6. Step 4 has feasibility concern surfacing with gentle tone ("Love that idea. One thing to keep in mind...")
7. Step 4 has periodic check-in guidance (every 4-6 exchanges)
8. Step 4 mentions natural pause detection for check-in timing
9. Placeholder updated to Steps 5-6
10. File is at least 150 lines
  </verify>
  <done>
Brainstorm skill has the exploration loop with adaptive context loading (GAMEPLAN.md on-demand, codebase files on-demand via Read/Glob/Grep), gentle feasibility surfacing, 200-300 word response guidance, and periodic check-ins every 4-6 exchanges.

<verification>
- Adaptive context loading rules are specific about WHEN to load (trigger phrases/patterns) and WHAT to load (which files)
- Code awareness uses Read/Glob/Grep directly (not mapper agent, per research recommendation)
- Feasibility concerns are gentle, not blocking, per locked decision
- Check-in timing respects natural conversation flow
- Response length guidance prevents walls of text
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Step 4 provides clear behavioral guidance for the exploration loop
- Adaptive context loading is the key differentiator -- explicit rules for when to escalate
- Locked decisions honored: code-aware, gentle feasibility, follow user's lead, check-in periodically
</success_criteria>
