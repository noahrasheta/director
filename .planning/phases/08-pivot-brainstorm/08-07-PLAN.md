<objective>
Complete the brainstorm skill by adding Steps 5-6 -- session ending with file save, and exit routing with single best action suggestion. This handles the wrap-up flow: generating a session summary, saving it to a dated file, and suggesting what to do next.

Purpose: Steps 5-6 turn the conversation into a lasting artifact and route the user to the most appropriate next action. The session file preserves key ideas and context for future reference. The routing is gentle -- "session saved" is always a valid ending.

Output: A complete `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` with all 6 steps -- the placeholder is removed and the skill is fully functional.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add brainstorm Steps 5-6 (session save and exit routing)</name>
  <files>skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Read the current `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` (which has Steps 1-4 from plans 08-05 and 08-06). Replace the `<!-- Steps 5-6 -->` placeholder with Steps 5-6 to complete the skill. Remove all placeholder markers.

**Step 5: Session ending and file save**

This step is triggered when:
- The user says "done", "that's it", "wrap up", "we're good", or similar wrap-up signal
- OR a periodic check-in from Step 4 receives a wrap-up response

**5a: Generate session summary**
Review the entire conversation and generate a structured summary following the template at `skills/brainstorm/templates/brainstorm-session.md`:

- **Key Ideas:** Extract 3-7 key ideas discussed. Each should be one sentence. Capture the idea itself, not just the topic.
- **Decisions Made:** If any decisions emerged during the session (user said "let's do X" or "I think Y is the way to go"), capture them. If no decisions were made, omit this section entirely.
- **Open Questions:** Unresolved items worth revisiting. Questions that came up but were not answered, or areas that need more thought. If none, omit this section.
- **Highlights:** Key excerpts and insights from the conversation. Not the full transcript -- just the parts worth revisiting. Include important reasoning, context, and aha moments. Write this as a narrative paragraph or short paragraphs, not bullet points.
- **Suggested Next Action:** ONE action (populated in Step 6).

**5b: Determine filename**
- If `$ARGUMENTS` was provided: derive a 2-4 word kebab-case slug from the arguments (e.g., "what about real-time collab?" becomes "real-time-collab").
- If no `$ARGUMENTS`: derive a 2-4 word kebab-case slug from the first/primary topic discussed.
- Full filename: `.director/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>.md` using today's date.

**5c: Handle filename collisions**
- Before writing, check if a file with that name already exists using the Read tool or Bash `ls`.
- If the file exists: append a counter: `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>-2.md`. If that also exists, try `-3.md`, etc.
- This prevents overwriting previous brainstorm sessions on the same topic.

**5d: Write the session file**
- Write the session file using the Write tool.
- Fill in the template format with the generated summary content.
- The "Suggested Next Action" section is populated in Step 6 before telling the user.

**Step 6: Suggest next action and wrap up**

Analyze the discussion content to determine the single best next action:

| Discussion Content | Suggested Action | Example Phrasing |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Concrete small change the user wants to make | Quick task | "That sounds like a quick change. Want me to handle it with `/director:quick`?" |
| New feature or capability that needs planning | Blueprint update | "This would fit nicely into your gameplan. Want to update it with `/director:blueprint`?" |
| Direction change -- user expressed intent to change what they are building | Pivot | "This changes where your project is heading. Want to run `/director:pivot` to update everything?" |
| Half-formed idea worth saving | Save as idea | "Interesting thought. I'll save it to your ideas list for later." |
| Pure exploration, no clear action needed | Session saved | "Session saved. Pick it back up anytime." |

**Important routing rules:**
- Default to "Session saved" when there is no clear action. Brainstorm sessions are valuable even without producing work. Do NOT pressure the user to take action. Per locked decision: "brainstorm sessions are valuable even without action."
- Only suggest pivot if the user explicitly expressed intent to change direction during the session (not just because they explored a what-if).
- Suggest the LEAST disruptive action that fits. If the user was exploring casually, "Session saved" is better than suggesting a blueprint update.

**Implementing the suggested action:**

After suggesting ONE action, wait for the user's response.

- If user accepts "save as idea": write the idea directly to `.director/IDEAS.md` using the same insertion mechanic as the idea skill (insert after `_Captured ideas` line, newest-first, format: `- **[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]** -- [idea text]`). Confirm: "Saved to your ideas list." Per research recommendation: write directly to IDEAS.md, do NOT suggest running /director:idea (that adds friction).
- If user accepts "quick task": tell the user to run `/director:quick "[specific task description]"`. Do NOT execute inline -- brainstorm context is too heavy for a clean quick task.
- If user accepts "blueprint update": tell the user to run `/director:blueprint "[specific focus]"`. Do NOT execute inline.
- If user accepts "pivot": tell the user to run `/director:pivot "[specific change description]"`. Do NOT execute inline.
- If user accepts "session saved" or says nothing: no further action needed.
- If user declines or wants something different: accommodate their preference.

**Final confirmation:**
After routing is complete, confirm the session was saved:

> "Session saved to your brainstorms folder."

Do NOT show the file path. The user just needs to know it is saved.

**Complete the Language Reminders section:**
Ensure the Language Reminders section at the bottom covers:
- Director vocabulary (Vision, Gameplan, Goal/Step/Task)
- No git jargon, no file paths in user output
- Conversational, match user's energy
- Never blame the user
- Follow terminology.md and plain-language-guide.md

Ensure `$ARGUMENTS` is at the very end of the file.

Read `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` and verify:
1. No placeholder markers remain
2. Step 5a generates session summary with Key Ideas, Decisions Made, Open Questions, Highlights
3. Step 5b derives filename from $ARGUMENTS or first topic discussed
4. Step 5c handles filename collisions with counter suffix
5. Step 5d writes session file using Write tool
6. Step 6 has routing table matching discussion content to actions
7. Step 6 defaults to "Session saved" when no clear action
8. Step 6 writes directly to IDEAS.md for save-as-idea route (not suggesting /director:idea)
9. Step 6 directs user to run commands for quick/blueprint/pivot routes (not executing inline)
10. Language reminders section is complete
11. $ARGUMENTS at the end
12. File is at least 230 lines
13. All 6 steps are present and numbered sequentially

  <done>
Brainstorm skill is fully complete with all 6 steps: init and vision check (Step 1), lightweight context loading (Step 2), session opening (Step 3), exploration loop with adaptive context loading (Step 4), session save with collision handling (Step 5), and exit routing with single best action suggestion (Step 6). Sessions are always saved to .director/brainstorms/ and routing defaults to "Session saved" when no action is clear.
