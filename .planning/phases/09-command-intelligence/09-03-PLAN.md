<objective>
Add inline text support to resume, audit error messaging and terminology across lightweight commands, and update reference docs.

Purpose: The research identified resume as the only command with no $ARGUMENTS handling. This plan adds it, then audits all lightweight commands (status, brainstorm, quick, idea, ideas) for error message consistency and terminology compliance, and ensures reference docs are complete for the full command set including undo.

Output: Updated resume skill with $ARGUMENTS, audited lightweight skills, and updated reference docs.

  <name>Task 1: Add $ARGUMENTS support to resume skill</name>
  <files>skills/resume/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Update skills/resume/SKILL.md to handle inline text via $ARGUMENTS. Currently resume has `$ARGUMENTS` at the end of the file but no logic that uses it.

Add a new Step 1b after Step 1 (check for project) and before Step 2 (calculate break length):

```
## Step 1b: Handle inline context

If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, store it as focus context for use in Steps 3 and 6.

The inline text influences the resume experience:
- In Step 3 (reconstruct last session): when summarizing what was accomplished, highlight any work related to the user's focus text.
- In Step 6 (suggest next action): when suggesting the next task, if there is a pending task matching the focus text, suggest that task specifically. If no match, acknowledge the focus: "You mentioned [arguments] -- the next ready task is [task name], which [explain how it relates or doesn't]."

Examples:
- `/director:resume "authentication"` -- highlights auth-related work in the recap and suggests auth-related next tasks
- `/director:resume "let's finish the dashboard"` -- focuses the next-action suggestion on dashboard tasks

If $ARGUMENTS text does not match any task, step, or recent activity: acknowledge it and proceed normally. Do NOT ask for clarification -- the text is a hint, not a command. Say something like: "You want to focus on [arguments] -- let me catch you up."
```

Also update Step 6 (suggest next action) to reference the stored focus context:

Add a paragraph after the existing next-action logic:

```
**If focus context was provided in Step 1b:** Adjust the next-action suggestion to reference the user's focus. If a ready task matches the focus text, lead with that task. If no match, present the default next task and briefly note how the user's focus relates to the current plan position.
```

Do NOT change any other steps. The resume skill is well-structured and only needs this addition.
  </action>
  <verify>
- skills/resume/SKILL.md contains Step 1b with $ARGUMENTS handling
- Step 6 references focus context from Step 1b
- $ARGUMENTS influence is limited to highlighting and suggestion focus (not changing resume behavior)
- The resume flow still works normally when $ARGUMENTS is empty
  </verify>
  <done>
Resume skill handles $ARGUMENTS as focus context that influences which work is highlighted in the recap and which task is suggested next. Normal resume flow is unchanged when no arguments are provided.
  </done>

This is an audit-then-fix task across lightweight commands and reference docs. Read each file, check for issues, and make targeted fixes.

**Part A: Audit error messaging in lightweight commands**

For each of these skills (status, brainstorm, quick, idea, ideas), read the full SKILL.md and check:

1. **Error/edge-case messages follow the three-part structure** (per locked decision CMDI-05):
   - What went wrong (state the situation)
   - Why (brief explanation)
   - What to do next (conversational suggestion)

   Check every user-facing message that handles an error or edge case. If any message is missing one of the three parts, add it.

2. **No developer jargon** (per CMDI-06):
   - Scan for any words from the never-use list in terminology.md
   - Check for git terms (commit, branch, SHA, diff, revert), backend terms (schema, migration, endpoint, middleware), workflow terms (dependency, artifact, blocker, prerequisite)
   - If found in user-facing message templates, rewrite using plain language

3. **Uses Director's terminology** (per CMDI-07):
   - Should say Goal/Step/Task, not milestone/phase/ticket
   - Should say Vision/Gameplan, not spec/roadmap
   - Should say "needs X first" not "blocked by X" or "depends on X"
   - Should say "progress saved" not "committed" or "pushed"

4. **Language Reminders section present** -- each skill should have a Language Reminders section referencing terminology.md and plain-language-guide.md. If missing, add it following the pattern from build/SKILL.md.

Make MINIMAL changes. Only fix actual issues found during the audit. Do NOT rewrite entire skills.

**Part B: Update reference/terminology.md**

Add these terms if not already present:

In the Term Mapping table:
- "Going back" maps to "Reverted, Rolled back" (verify this exists -- it should from Phase 1)
- Add "Undo" -> "Revert, Rollback, Git reset" -- "Going back to before that task"

In the Words to NEVER Use section:
- Verify "rollback" and "revert" are in the list (they should be covered under Git terms)
- Add "reset" to the Git/version control terms if not present (as in "git reset")

In the Words That Are OK section:
- Add "undo" to General tech terms if not present (users understand "undo")
- Add "go back" or "going back" if not present

In the Phrasing Examples section, add an undo-specific example:

```
### Bad (exposing git internals)
> Commit abc123 has been reverted. HEAD now points to def456.

### Good (abstracted)
> Done -- went back to before the login page task. Your project is back to where it was.
```

**Part C: Update reference/plain-language-guide.md**

In Rule 6 (errors), verify the existing examples cover the patterns Director actually uses. If not, add one that demonstrates the three-part error structure:

```
**Bad:** "Error: No ready tasks found."
**Good:** "There's nothing ready to build right now. The next tasks need the login page finished first. Want to check on that with /director:inspect?"
```

In the Routing Message Template section, verify the examples are still accurate. If the undo command introduces any new routing scenarios, add an example:

```
### Example: User runs /director:undo with no project

> "Nothing to undo -- no project set up yet. Want to get started with `/director:onboard`?"
```

Wait -- per the undo skill spec, undo says "Nothing to undo -- no project set up yet." and stops (no redirect suggestion). This is correct because undo is a targeted action, not a workflow entry point. Do NOT add an undo routing example to the guide. The existing examples suffice.

Make MINIMAL changes to reference docs. Only add what is missing for completeness.

- reference/plain-language-guide.md is up-to-date with current command set
- No unnecessary changes made -- audit scope only

All lightweight command error messages follow the three-part structure (what/why/what to do). No developer jargon found or it was replaced. Reference docs updated with undo-related terminology. All skills reference the terminology and plain-language guides.

- Resume skill accepts $ARGUMENTS and uses it to focus the recap and next-action suggestion
- Error messages in status, brainstorm, quick, idea, ideas all follow three-part structure
- No developer jargon in any user-facing message templates across all audited skills
- Director terminology (Goal, Step, Task, Vision, Gameplan) used consistently
- terminology.md includes undo-related terms
- plain-language-guide.md reflects current command set
- No unnecessary changes -- audit found and fixed only actual issues

<success_criteria>
Every command accepts inline text (resume was the last holdout). All error messages use plain language with what/why/what-to-do structure. Director's terminology is enforced throughout. Reference docs are complete and current. CMDI-04, CMDI-05, CMDI-06, and CMDI-07 requirements are satisfied.
