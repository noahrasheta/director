<objective>
Rewrite the README as an install-focused landing page for GitHub discovery, with correct install commands matching the finalized marketplace manifest.

Purpose: The README is the primary discovery surface for Director. Per user decision, it should be rewritten as an install-focused landing page: install instructions first, quick start, then what Director does. Both install paths (one-liner and step-by-step) must reference the correct marketplace name from 10-01's marketplace.json.
Output: README.md rewritten as an install landing page with dual install paths and command reference.

  <name>Task 1: Rewrite README as install-focused landing page</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite README.md as an install-focused landing page. The current README has correct content but needs restructuring to lead with installation per user decision. The README serves as the primary GitHub discovery path -- users decide to install based on what they see here.

Structure (follow this order exactly):

**1. Title and tagline:**
```
# Director

**Opinionated orchestration for vibe coders.**
```

**2. One-paragraph description (3-4 sentences):**
Director is a Claude Code plugin for solo builders who use AI to build software. It guides the entire process -- from capturing your vision, to planning your build, to verifying it works. You think about what to build; Director handles the how.

**3. Install section (FIRST major section -- this is the most important change):**

Heading: `## Install`

State the requirement: `Requires [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) v1.0.33 or later.`

Sub-heading: `### Quick Install`
One-liner command in a code block:
```
/plugin marketplace add noahrasheta/director && /plugin install director@director-marketplace
```

Then: `Then run /director:onboard to get started.`

Sub-heading: `### Step by Step`
Numbered list:
1. Open Claude Code
2. Run `/plugin marketplace add noahrasheta/director`
3. Run `/plugin install director@director-marketplace`
4. Run `/director:onboard` to set up your first project

Both paths produce the same result. Add a brief note: "Both methods install the same plugin."

**4. What Director Does section:**
Brief explanation of the three-part workflow loop:
- **Blueprint** -- Capture your vision and create a gameplan (goals, steps, and tasks)
- **Build** -- Execute tasks one at a time with fresh AI context, so quality stays high
- **Inspect** -- Verify that what you built actually works the way you intended

Add: "Each task gets a fresh AI workspace loaded with just the context it needs. This keeps things fast, accurate, and focused."

**5. Commands section:**
Keep the EXISTING command table structure from the current README (it's already well-organized into Blueprint/Build/Inspect/Other groupings with examples). Preserve ALL content here -- the 12 commands (including undo), the descriptions, and the examples. Update the intro line to say "12 commands" instead of "11 commands" (undo was added in Phase 9). Make sure undo appears in the Other group table:
```
| `/director:undo` | Go back to before the last task. Reverts the most recent change Director made. |
```

**6. What Director Creates section:**
Keep the existing .director/ folder description. Brief, informative.

**7. Requirements section:**
- Claude Code v1.0.33 or later
- A project you want to build (new or existing)

**8. Links section:**
- Website: director.cc
- Source: github.com/noahrasheta/director
- License: MIT

**9. License section:**
`MIT` (single line)

Key principles:
- Lead with audience and outcomes, not technical capabilities (per user decision)
- Homepage director.cc and GitHub repo both referenced (per user decision)
- Install commands must match the marketplace name "director-marketplace" from 10-01
- Plain language throughout -- no jargon
- No mention of "self-check" or implementation details -- users don't need to know about internals
  </action>
  <verify>
Read README.md and verify: (1) Install section appears before Commands section, (2) both install paths are present with correct marketplace commands, (3) "director-marketplace" appears in install commands, (4) all 12 commands are listed (including undo), (5) Claude Code version requirement is stated, (6) director.cc and GitHub links are present, (7) no developer jargon.
  </verify>
  <done>README.md is an install-focused landing page with dual install paths, correct marketplace commands, all 12 commands listed, and vibe-coder-friendly language throughout</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `grep 'plugin marketplace add noahrasheta/director' README.md` finds the install command
- `grep 'director-marketplace' README.md` confirms correct marketplace name reference
- `grep 'director:undo' README.md` confirms undo command is listed
- `grep -c 'director:' README.md` shows all 12 commands are referenced
- README.md Install section appears before Commands section (visual check)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- README leads with installation (Install is the first major section after intro)
- Both install paths present: one-liner and step-by-step
- Install commands reference "director-marketplace" correctly
- All 12 commands documented with descriptions and examples
- Vibe-coder-friendly language throughout (no jargon)
- director.cc and GitHub repo both linked
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/10-distribution/10-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
