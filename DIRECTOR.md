# DIRECTOR

**The framework for vibe coders who ship.**

You have the vision. AI has the skills. Director is the structure between them.

## What Is Director?

Director is an agentic orchestration framework built for vibe coders — solo builders who use AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.) to bring their ideas to life.

It is a curated, opinionated plugin that layers on top of existing AI coding agents to provide the structure, guardrails, and workflow intelligence that turns ad-hoc AI prompting into disciplined, spec-driven development. Think of it as the difference between giving an actor a vague idea and handing a film crew a complete shooting script. Director is the shooting script.

Director combines agents, skills, slash commands, and hooks into a single cohesive framework that guides the entire build process from initial vision through goals, steps, and final delivery.

## Why Does Director Exist?

Vibe coding has unlocked something powerful: the ability to build real software by directing AI rather than writing every line by hand. But the ability to build and the ability to build *well* are different things. The bottleneck is no longer coding — it's knowing how to *direct* AI effectively: how to break a vision into structured specs, how to manage complex multi-phase builds, and how to maintain quality and consistency across an entire project.

Without a framework, vibe coders fall into common traps:

- Starting to build before defining what they're building
- Losing context and coherence across long, complex projects
- Producing inconsistent code with no enforced standards
- Having no clear milestones, so projects drift indefinitely
- Reinventing workflows for every new project instead of following a repeatable system

Existing open-source frameworks solve pieces of this problem, but they were all built for traditional developers. Director was born from evaluating dozens of these tools, extracting the best patterns from each, and combining them into one unified framework designed for how vibe coders actually work.

### Inspirations and Predecessors

Director builds on the shoulders of projects like:

- **[GSD (Get Shit Done)](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)** - Spec-driven development workflow
- **[Taches CC Resources](https://github.com/glittercowboy/taches-cc-resources)** - Command structures for Claude Code
- **[wshobson/commands](https://github.com/wshobson/commands)** - Developer command patterns
- **[Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)** - Agent capability extensions
- **[Claude Task Master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master)** - Task management for AI-driven development

Director is not a fork of any single project. It is a ground-up synthesis of the best ideas across the ecosystem, customized and refined for the solo builder workflow.

## Who Is Director For?

**Primary audience:** Vibe coders — solo builders who use AI coding agents to build real products.

These are people who:

- Have a vision for what they want to build and use AI to make it real
- Are comfortable in a terminal and actively learning the craft of AI-assisted development
- Have discovered AI coding agents and recognize their potential but know they could get more from them with better structure
- Want a repeatable, structured process rather than figuring it out from scratch every time
- Are building SaaS products, personal tools, portfolio pieces, or automation systems
- Value shipping over perfection

**Secondary audiences:** Marketers building automation systems, students working on complex projects, and anyone who uses AI agents to build structured, multi-phase work products.

## Core Principles

1. **Spec first, build second.** Every project begins with a specification. No code gets written until the AI understands exactly what it's building, why, and how success is measured.

2. **Structure enables speed.** A good framework doesn't slow you down. It eliminates the decisions that slow you down so you can focus on the decisions that matter.

3. **You direct, AI executes.** The human provides vision, priorities, and judgment. The AI provides implementation, iteration, and technical execution. Director is the protocol between them.

4. **Solo doesn't mean sloppy.** Solo builders deserve the same rigor and consistency that engineering teams enforce through process. Director provides that rigor without the overhead.

5. **Open by default.** Director is open source because the best tools are built by communities, not gatekeepers.

## Key Capabilities

- **Spec-driven development workflow** with structured project initialization
- **Milestone and phase management** for complex, multi-stage builds
- **Custom slash commands** (invoked with `/d`) for fast, repeatable actions
- **Agent orchestration** that coordinates multiple AI capabilities within a single session
- **Skill modules** that provide domain-specific intelligence (web apps, APIs, landing pages, automation, etc.)
- **Hooks and guardrails** that enforce quality standards and prevent common mistakes
- **Project context persistence** so AI agents maintain coherence across long builds

## The Vision

Director aims to become the default framework that vibe coders install the moment they set up a new AI coding agent. It should be the first thing you reach for when starting a new project, not an afterthought you add when things get messy.

Long term, Director represents a thesis: that the most valuable skill in the AI era is not coding, but *directing*. Knowing how to think strategically about what to build, how to structure the work, and how to orchestrate AI agents to execute on that vision. Director is both the tool and the proof of that thesis.
