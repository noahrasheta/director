| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------|
| _[feature]_ | _[user expectation]_ | _LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH_ | _[implementation notes]_ |
| _[feature]_ | _[user expectation]_ | _LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH_ | _[implementation notes]_ |
| _[feature]_ | _[user expectation]_ | _LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH_ | _[implementation notes]_ |

### Nice-to-Haves

_Features that provide competitive advantage. Not required, but valuable._

## Feature Priorities

_How should features be ordered based on user value and build cost?_

| Feature | User Value | Build Cost | Priority |
|---------|------------|------------|----------|
| _[feature]_ | _HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW_ | _HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW_ | _P1/P2/P3_ |
| _[feature]_ | _HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW_ | _HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW_ | _P1/P2/P3_ |
| _[feature]_ | _HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW_ | _HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW_ | _P1/P2/P3_ |

_Priority key: P1 = must have for launch, P2 = should have when possible, P3 = future consideration._
